        <li> <h2> Causes: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> <h3>Inherited traits.</h3> <h3> It could be genetical errors passed down from our elders, or it wasn't active until some external factors stimulated it e.g domestic violance, long-term mental abuse, etc.</h3> </li>
                <li> <h3>External stimulants.</h3> <h3> It could be the result of long-term exposures of unhealthy influences such as family pressures, bullying behaviors, insecurity, or most recently, cyber-bullying </h3> </li>
                <li><h3>Lack of healthy & supportive relationships.</h3> <h3> This is one of the biggest root of mental unstability. Either you have friends or family members that don't genuinely care and support you, or you isolate yourself from everyone and the loneliness grows bigger and bigger every day.</h3> </li>
                <li> <h3>Childhood traumas. </h3><h3> Mental illnesses could emerge from traumatic events you've experienced when you were young, and without early interventions, it could develop into life-long phobias </h3> </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li> <h2> Consequences: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3> Suicidal thoughts. </h3></li>
                <li> <h3>Delination in pleasure towards life.</h3> </li>
                <li> <h3>Negative affects on relationships.</h3> </li> 
                <li> <h3>Drugs addictions.</h3> </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        <li> <h2> Solutions: </h2>
            <ol> 
                <li> <h3>Supports from family and friends.</h3> <h3> You should seek for help from your close ones. Choose one person that you trust the most, one that will not be judgemental towards your illness and will genuinely listen to you. However, if your family or friends are the cause of your illness, do not hesitate to reach out for professional supports. There are always professional therapists or healthcare workers that will be willing to help you get through your depression. </h3> </li>
                <li> <h3> Gain control over your life.</h3> <h3> In order to do this, you can either change yourself, or change the environment you're living in. </h3> <ul> <li> Find new interests. Take up fresh, healthy hobbies, that will keep your mind away from negative feelings, such as working out, learn new activities, go sky-diving, etc.</li>
